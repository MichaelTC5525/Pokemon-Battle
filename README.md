# Pokemon-Battle
A Haskell Project for CPSC312-2022W-T2 at UBC

## Introduction

Since Haskell is great for games, our team decided to make a turn-based game inspired by the popular RPG franchise of Pokemon, where we will simulate a single turn-based battle.

See the [UBC Wiki](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:CPSC312-2023/Pokemon_Battle) page for more information.
